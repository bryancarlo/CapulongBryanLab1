# CapulongBryanLab1
1. Double clicking the executable JAR file for me does not run it, but I run it by typing java -jar CapulongBryanLab1.jar on CMD while
inside the directory where the executable JAR is located.
2. The .jar file that the project w/ the test class needs to reference is in the Regular Class folder. 
-I have noticed that when importing the project to a different computer in Eclipse requires one to reconfigure the build path and add the
External jar once again because the file location is different in another computer.
